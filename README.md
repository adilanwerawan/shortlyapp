### Brief

Shortly app is based on the purpose of URL shortening which is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. 

-   In this repo I have used Swift + MVVM + UIKit(Constraints programmatically) + Combine
-   [shrtcode API](https://app.shrtco.de/docs) has been used
-   UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and NSDiffableDataSourceSnapshot has been used for rendering the data on collection view list.
-   iOS Minimum Version Support : 13.2
